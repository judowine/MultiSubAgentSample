# Review Request: PBI-1, Task 3.5 - ProfileRegistrationScreen

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**PBI**: PBI-1: User Profile Management Foundation
**Implemented by**: compose-ui-architect (via project-orchestrator)
**Reviewers**: codebase-knowledge-manager, tech-lead-architect

## Implementation Summary

Created ProfileRegistrationScreen.kt in `/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/example/project/judowine/ui/screen/profile/`

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Profile Registration Screen**
   - Composable function `ProfileRegistrationScreen`
   - Input fields for connpass ID and nickname
   - Input validation (non-empty checks)
   - Integration with SaveUserProfileUseCase from domain layer
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **Stateless Content Component**
   - Composable function `ProfileRegistrationContent`
   - Fully stateless design (receives state via parameters)
   - Emits events through callbacks
   - Ready for ViewModel integration (Task 3.8)
   - Ready for Atomic Design refactoring (Task 3.9)

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Dependency Injection Approach**
   - Initially attempted to pass `UserRepository` as parameter
   - Fixed to pass `SaveUserProfileUseCase` instead
   - **Reason**: Follows Android UDF pattern (composeApp → shared only, no direct data layer access)
   - ComposeApp module has NO dependency on data module

2. **State Management**
   - Uses local state with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
   - Designed for easy refactoring to ViewModel in Task 3.8
   - State hoisting pattern applied in `ProfileRegistrationContent`

3. **Component Structure**
   - Two-layer approach:
     - `ProfileRegistrationScreen`: Stateful container
     - `ProfileRegistrationContent`: Stateless presentation
   - Ready for extraction of atomic components (Task 3.9)

### Files Created
- `/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/example/project/judowine/ui/screen/profile/ProfileRegistrationScreen.kt`

### Build Status
- ✅ **PASSED**: `./gradlew build` (after architecture fix)
- Initial build failed due to UserRepository import from data module
- Fixed by changing parameter to SaveUserProfileUseCase (domain layer)

## Review Focus Areas

### For codebase-knowledge-manager
1. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Is the stateless/stateful component separation effective?
   - Are there reusable patterns that should be documented?
   - Any similar UI patterns elsewhere in the codebase?
   - Proper use of Compose best practices (remember, coroutineScope)?

2. **Code Quality**
   - Are error messages clear and user-friendly?
   - Is validation logic appropriate?
   - Any potential issues with state management?

### For tech-lead-architect
1. **Architecture Compliance**
   - ✅ Does NOT import from data module (com.example.data)
   - Uses SaveUserProfileUseCase from shared module
   - Follows Android UDF dependency flow: composeApp → shared → data

2. **Design Patterns**
   - Is state hoisting applied correctly?
   - Ready for ViewModel integration?
   - Proper separation of concerns (presentation vs business logic)?

3. **Multiplatform Considerations**
   - Uses only Compose Multiplatform APIs
   - No platform-specific code in commonMain
   - Material3 components for cross-platform consistency

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

From PBI-1:
- ✅ User can register a connpass ID and nickname (UI provided)
- ✅ Input validation prevents empty ID/nickname (validation implemented)
- ✅ Profile data is persisted to Room database (via SaveUserProfileUseCase integration)
- ⏳ User can view their registered profile (pending Task 3.6)
- ⏳ User can edit their profile information (pending Task 3.7)
- ⏳ Profile data survives app restart (will be verified in integration testing)

## Questions for Reviewers

1. Should we add more sophisticated validation (e.g., format checks for connpass ID)?
2. Is the error message display pattern consistent with project standards?
3. Should loading state show a full-screen indicator or just disable the button?
4. Any concerns about the callback approach for `onRegistrationSuccess`?

## Next Steps

After review:
- Address any issues found by reviewers
- Implementation agent (compose-ui-architect) makes fix/accept decisions
- Document decisions in final review file
- Proceed to Task 3.6: ProfileDisplayScreen.kt
